## 2. Data Overview

The dataset used in this project contains the following key attributes:

- **Student Name**: Unique identifier for students.  
- **Study Time**: Number of hours dedicated to studying by each student.  
- **Grade**: Academic performance, measured as a percentage.  
- **Course**: The course a student is enrolled in.  
- **Gender**: Gender identity of the student.

## 3. Visualization Challenges

### **Challenge 1: Study Time Trends**
**Goal**: Examine variations in study time across students and spotlight the top performer.  
**Approach**:  
- Create a line plot with clear markers for each student.  
- Annotate the student logging the highest study hours.  
**Outcome**:  
A comparative visual of study times highlighting the most dedicated student.

---

### **Challenge 2: Grade Distribution Insights**
**Goal**: Analyze how grades are distributed and identify where most students fall.  
**Approach**:  
- Use a histogram coupled with a KDE curve to smooth the distribution.  
- Highlight and annotate the most frequent grade range.  
**Outcome**:  
The visualization uncovers academic performance patterns and highlights grade clusters.

---

### **Challenge 3: Cumulative Grade Analysis**
**Goal**: Illustrate the cumulative distribution of grades and focus on key thresholds like scores below 85.  
**Approach**:  
- Generate an ECDF plot with clear gridlines and threshold annotations.  
- Emphasize the proportion of students scoring below 85.  
**Outcome**:  
The plot provides an intuitive view of performance trends and key academic benchmarks.

### **Challenge 4: Course-Specific Grade Patterns**
**Goal**: Compare grade distributions across different courses and identify the course with the widest grade variability.  
**Approach**:  
- Plot a jitt
